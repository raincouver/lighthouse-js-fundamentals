// Challenge
// We will be writing a program that prints the numbers from 100 to 200 to the console, with three exceptions:

// If the number is a multiple of 3, print the string "Loopy" instead of the number.
// If the number is a multiple of 4, print the string "Lighthouse" instead of the number.
// If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 4, print the string "LoopyLighthouse" instead of the number.
// By print, we are referring to console.log.
